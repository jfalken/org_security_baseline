# Organizational Security Base

This spreadsheet can be used to quickly perform a self-assessment of the maturity of controls around a particular scoped domain.

After assessing your security controls maturity, you can use this information to help triage  whats important to focus on, based on your company's needs.

By 'scoped domain', we refer to scope as defined in an [ISMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security_management_system). For example, you could scope this questionnaire to apply to a particular product's development lifecycle, and then proceed to answer the questions with that scope in mind.

The process of self-assessing should be regular (once a quarter, for example). Any changes in maturity (up or down), should be documented and used to help drive security program control decisions.

Please note; it would be normal to have several of these spreadsheets, each with a different scope. A scope of 'whole company' should be considered too broad and will be difficult to assess accurately.

## How to Use

First, [download the spreadsheet here](https://github.com/jfalken/org_security_baseline/archive/1.0.zip), or from the [releases](https://github.com/jfalken/org_security_baseline/releases) section.

Instructions are on the first page of the excel spreadsheet.

1. Determine the Scope you want to assess
2. Review the 'Maturity Metric' tab to make sure you understand how to score
3. On the 'Questionnaire' tab, review each question and rate your scoped domain. Interviewing subject matter experts is probably a good thing to do while doing this.

A Summary of all results / ratings is provided on the 'Summary' tab.

## Completeness

This spreadsheet is in no way exhaustive; it was creating by reviewing the security controls domains identified in [ISO 27002:2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27002) and developing a very small subset of questions that apply to each domain. Feel free to customize the questions, or add more.
